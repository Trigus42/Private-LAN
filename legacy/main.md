## Guide
Even if you don't wan't to use all services I would recommend setting up those you do want to in the following order.  

- ### [DNSCrypt-Proxy](DNSCrypt.md)
  Must be set up before configuring Pi-Hole to use localhost:5300 as DNS.

- ### [VPN Gateway](VPNGateway.md)
  Must be set up before configuring the Pi-Hole DHCP to advertise your server as network gateway.

- ### [Pi-Hole](Pi-Hole.md)

- ### [PiVPN](PiVPN.md)

- ### [Advanced](Advanced.md)
  - Leak testing
  - Automated security updates
  - Simple Firewall
  - Per devices rules and timed rules
